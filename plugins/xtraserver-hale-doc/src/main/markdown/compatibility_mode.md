# XtraServer compatibility mode

To help the user discern which functions are compatible with an XtraServer mapping and which are not, an XtraServer compatibility mode has been added to hale studio.

Once the mode is activated, the mapping function selection menu in the schema explorer view will only list the functions which are compatible with the XtraServer mapping, and a red cross will appear at the bottom right corner of the window if the alignment cannot be automatically translated to XtraServer mapping.
